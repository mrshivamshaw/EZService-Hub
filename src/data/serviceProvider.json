I'm always busy and don't want anyone to think I am rejecting their task without communication. Sending me a message will help the notification as well. Other than that first snippet, I enjoy doing things differently than most people's average day, and I have more potential to help someone out than I would if I were solely working a payroll job. I also enjoy getting to see what I am in for, for each day. (I'm a secret service agent, here to do secret service agent stuff. It's in parentheses because it's a secret. I deliver classified documents, complete classified yard work, fight through classified plant missions, and only shed some classified tears.)",
        "skill":"Cleaning? I've been cleaning since I was born. Do I enjoy cleaning? As a teenager, I can assure you, I did not. As an adult? I can assure you that cleaning is one of my favorite things to do. Especially when it is a particularly difficult job, because I enjoy the process, thinking of better ways to clean, and then the end result. You'll probably enjoy it as much as I do after seeing the finished product once I am done.",
